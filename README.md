Prt 1: A simple yet reliable assay for chemotaxis in <i>C. elegans</i>

This paper develops a new assay for examining the behavior of wild-type <i>C. elegans</i> in response to odorant exposure. The protocol for assays used to generate the data (Chemotaxis.docx), the datasets acquired (Supplemental Dataset 1.xlsx), the R codes used for plotting the data (TasnimLiuJose_microPub_1.R), and example data for use with the code (Example_data.zip) are included here.
